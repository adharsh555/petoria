  Modern pet owners often face numerous challenges in ensuring the well-being and happiness of their pets, including securing timely advice for health or behavioral concerns, managing medication schedules, vaccinations, dietary preferences, and grooming appointments. Additionally, sourcing quality pet products can be inconsistent, and the lack of personalized guidance can lead to suboptimal decisions. There is also a lack of virtual companions to address pet-related queries in real-time, leaving pet owners feeling isolated and uncertain.

To address these challenges, I developed PETORIA, an AI-powered pet care platform built using Firebase and FlutterFlow. The platform integrates machine learning algorithms for behavior analysis, personalized recommendations, and predictive insights, providing pet owners with an intuitive and efficient way to manage their pets' well-being.

->  Key features and accomplishments include:

*  AI-Driven Analytics: Personalizing pet management recommendations, automating deliveries, and enhancing user engagement through the use of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, ensuring data-driven decisions and a tailored experience.

*  Real-Time Intelligent Notifications: Engineered a notification system that reduced missed appointments by 40% and boosted customer satisfaction to 95%, according to user feedback surveys. This led to improvements in communication and task management efficiency.

*  Platform Deployment & Monitoring: Took ownership of the platform’s deployment, performance monitoring, and integration, ensuring successful implementation and scalability with automated email notifications and updates.

*  Innovation & Cost-Efficiency: Aligned the platform’s technology with the latest trends to drive innovation while maintaining cost-effectiveness, ensuring the platform's long-term viability.

PETORIA simplifies pet ownership by integrating personalized care and real-time support, enhancing both the user experience and operational efficiency.
